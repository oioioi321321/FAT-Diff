# 🚀 FAT-Diff: Decoupling Structural Topology and Generative Realism for Extreme Face Super-Resolution

Official PyTorch implementation of **FAT-Diff**, a two-stage framework for extreme face super-resolution that decouples structural topology recovery and generative detail enhancement.

> **Status:** Under Review
> **Code Release:** To be released upon acceptance
> **Pretrained Models:** To be released upon acceptance

## 🏗️ Framework

### Stage I: Facial Topology-Aware Structure Construction

FAT-Net leverages graph-based attention mechanisms guided by the proposed Facial Topology Guidance Matrix (FTGM) to recover global facial structures from severely degraded inputs.

### Stage II: Diffusion-based Texture Refinement

A diffusion refinement network further restores high-frequency facial details and improves perceptual realism while maintaining identity consistency.
